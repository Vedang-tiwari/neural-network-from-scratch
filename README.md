this is my self code two versions of neural network from scratch where it is performing forward propagation as well as backward propagation with optimization of gradient descent and activation relu and this is made without using machine learning libraries like sckit learn , tensorflow ,keras etc i haven't use any of it just plain numpy and pandas for my better understanding of a neural network and in future i will be improving this code with tons of update versions of my own neural network
